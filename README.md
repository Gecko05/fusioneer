# SMT Fusioneer

CLI tool to find a path of fusions with a specific party of demons that produces a target demon.
Currently working only for SMT I, SMT II and SMT IF... using normal double fusion and not thoroughly tested.
Most of the source code comes from this amazing repo: [https://github.com/aqiu384/](https://github.com/aqiu384/megaten-fusion-tool)https://github.com/aqiu384/megaten-fusion-tool

Usage:

```fusioneer-win.exe game demon1 demon2 demon3 ... targetDemon```

Where game can be: ```smt```, ```smt2``` or ```smtif```

Consult: [https://aqiu384.github.io/megaten-fusion-tool/home](https://aqiu384.github.io/megaten-fusion-tool/home) for the correct demon names.

If you need to type in a demon name that has two words, use double quotes e.g. ```fusioneer_win.exe smt2 Ogre "Zombie Dog" "High Pixie" Chernobog```
