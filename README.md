# Fusioneer

CLI tool to find a path of fusions with a specific party of demons that produces a target demon.
Currently working only for SMT If... using double fusion and not thoroughly tested.
Most of the source code comes from this amazing repo: [https://github.com/aqiu384/](https://github.com/aqiu384/megaten-fusion-tool)https://github.com/aqiu384/megaten-fusion-tool
